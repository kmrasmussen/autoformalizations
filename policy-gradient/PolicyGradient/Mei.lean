*On the Global Convergence Rates of Softmax Policy Gradient Methods*,
arXiv:2005.06392.

The paper's headline results:

* **Lemma 7** — `V^{π_θ}` is `8/(1-γ)³`-smooth. Already proved as
  `smoothAt_V_final`, with the paper's exact constant.
* **Lemma 8** — the *non-uniform Łojasiewicz* inequality: the gradient norm is
  bounded below by the suboptimality, times a coefficient that degrades as the
  policy's probability on optimal actions shrinks.
* **Theorem 4** — `O(1/t)` convergence, with a constant `c` the paper admits is
  non-explicit.

## The dependency the paper does not advertise

Mei's Lemma 9 (`c > 0`) is proved by citing *"the asymptotic convergence results
of Agarwal et al. [Theorem 5.1]"*. It is **not proved in their paper**. We have
that content (`ascent_converges`, `optimal_of_greedy`), so Theorem 4 is
reachable here in a way it is not from Mei alone.

Following the paper's own framing, `c` enters as an explicit hypothesis: their
theorem statement says "`c` the positive constant from Lemma 9", so carrying it
as a hypothesis is faithful, not a weakening.

`min_s π(a*(s)|s)` — the smallest probability the policy assigns to an optimal
action, across states. Mei's Lemma 8 shows the gradient is bounded below by the
suboptimality times this quantity (divided by `√|S|` and the distribution
mismatch coefficient).

The whole difficulty of Theorem 4 lives here: this can be exponentially small,
which is why the `O(1/t)` rate hides an exponential constant. -/

/-- **The Łojasiewicz mechanism.**

The `π`-weighted advantage at a state is bounded below by the Łojasiewicz
coefficient times the optimal-action advantage, whenever that advantage is
nonnegative.

This is the inequality Mei's Lemma 8 turns into a gradient bound: the gradient
carries a factor `π(a|s)`, so the *policy's own probability* on the optimal
action controls how much signal the gradient has. When that probability is tiny
the gradient is tiny even though the suboptimality is large — which is exactly
why the constant `c` in Theorem 4 can be exponentially small. -/

### Suboptimality controlled by the optimal-action advantage

`performance_difference` says the value gap is the visitation-weighted advantage
gap. Against a deterministic optimal policy that gap is the optimal-action
advantage, so the suboptimality is a visitation-weighted sum of those.
-/

/-- **Suboptimality as a weighted sum of optimal-action advantages.**

`V^{π*}_m(s₀) - V^π_m(s₀) = ∑ₖ γᵏ ∑ₛ visit^{π*} k s₀ s · A^π_{m-1-k}(s, a*(s))`

The right-hand side is what the Łojasiewicz argument bounds: if every
optimal-action advantage is small then the policy is near-optimal, and the
Łojasiewicz coefficient says the gradient sees a `π(a*|s)` fraction of it. -/

/-- **If every optimal-action advantage is nonpositive, the policy is optimal
against the deterministic comparison.**

The converse direction of the Łojasiewicz argument: no advantage means no
suboptimality. Combined with `optimal_of_greedy` this is how the limit of the
optimization is identified as optimal. -/

### Theorem 4 — the `O(1/t)` rate

Mei's Theorem 4 states, with `η = (1-γ)³/8` and `c` the constant from their
Lemma 9,

  `V*(ρ) - V^{π_θₜ}(ρ) ≤ 16S/(c²(1-γ)⁶t) · ‖d_μ^{π*}/μ‖²_∞ · ‖1/μ‖_∞`

The structure is: smoothness (`smoothAt_V_final`, our `8/(1-γ)³`) plus the
Łojasiewicz bound gives a quadratic decrease, and `quad_decrease_rate` turns
that into `1/t`. That composition is `domination_rate`, already proved.

`c` is a hypothesis here, exactly as in the paper — their statement reads "`c`
the positive constant from Lemma 9", and Lemma 9 is proved by citing AKM
Theorem 5.1 rather than from first principles.
-/

/-- **Mei Theorem 4, in the form the machinery delivers.**

A `β`-smooth objective satisfying a Łojasiewicz bound with coefficient `c`,
optimized by gradient ascent at stepsize `1/β`, has suboptimality `≤ 2β/(c²T)`.

Instantiating `β = 8/(1-γ)³` (our `smoothAt_V_final`, the paper's exact
constant) gives `16/(c²(1-γ)³T)` — the paper's `16S/(c²(1-γ)⁶t)` up to the
`|S|` and distribution-mismatch factors that come from converting the
per-coordinate Łojasiewicz bound into a norm bound. -/
